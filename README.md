# Graph-PHP

This project provides a modular and extensible framework for creating, managing, and visualizing graphs using *PHP*. It supports various graph types, including Wheel Graphs, K-Partite Graphs, and Complete Graphs, allowing developers to define and manipulate vertices and edges programmatically. With built-in validation and an easy-to-use structure, the system is ideal for learning, experimentation, and integrating graph-based solutions into applications.
